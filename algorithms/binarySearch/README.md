# 🔍 Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.

## 📌 Key Points

✅ Works only on **sorted arrays**  
✅ Much faster than linear search  

---

## ⚙️ Complexity

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Time  | **O(log n)** |
| Space | **O(1)** |

---

## 📌 Notes

⚠️ The array **must be sorted**.  
Binary search does **not** work correctly on unsorted arrays.

## 📌 Use Cases

- Searching in sorted arrays  
- Finding insertion position (*Search Insert Position*)  
- Finding boundaries (*lower bound / upper bound*)
