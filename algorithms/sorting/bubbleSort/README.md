# Bubble Sort Implementation in JavaScript

A simple and clean implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using JavaScript.

## Description
**Bubble Sort** is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

**How to use**
Just copy the function into your script and call it:
```javascript
const result = bubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 1]);
console.log(result);
```

### Installation & Running
1. Clone this repository or download the `bubble-sort.js` file.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node bubble-sort.js 


**Complexity Analysis**

1. **Worst-case time complexity:** $O(n^2)$

2. **Average-case time complexity:** $O(n^2)$

3. **Best-case time complexity:** $O(n)$ (with optimization)

4. **Space complexity:** $O(1)$ (In-place)
